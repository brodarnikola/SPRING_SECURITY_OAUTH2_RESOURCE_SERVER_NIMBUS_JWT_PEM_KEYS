First create database on your localhost. Add correct username and password for your database.

Here in this example I'm using "Mysql", but you can for example also use "Postgresql"

After that you can launch application.

How to test it ?
For example with "Postman", "Bruno"

"POST", "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" ,
"Body: JSON
    {
         "username": "exampleuser",
         "password": "examplepassword"
    }
"
